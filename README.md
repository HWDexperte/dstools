DSTools is a collection of scripts and tools for the German version of [Tribalwars (Die St√§mme)][1].


Usage
-----

First you need to install a Browser-Extension which loads user scripts.  
For Firefox exists [Greasemonkey],  
for Chrome [Tampermonkey]

After you've successfully installed one of these, you can view the source of any of the scripts in this repository. If you want to install a script, simply click on the "Raw" tab.

Grease-/Tampermonkey should notice that you are loading a `*.user.js` - File and offers you the option to install the script.

After the installation the script triggers itself on any page defined in the `@include` tags of the `==UserScript==` - Header
